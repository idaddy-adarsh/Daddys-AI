agar market badi wali strike price pe shift hoke aur badi strike price pe wtt ya shift ho jaye to bull run hoga

agar market choti wali strike price pe shift hoke aur choti strike price pe wtt ya shift ho jaye to blood bath hoga

hamesha oi ya volume jo bhi imaginary line ke karib hai use support ya resistence consider karenge
call side me choti strike ko 
put side me badi strike ko

6 kind of reversal hote hai eor eos support resistance diversion end of diversion

end of diversion ka matlab hai ki gabhi akkhri diversion hota hai .

natural weakness ka funda:-
agar koi bhi resistance ya support jaha se shift hue hai agar wahi weakness dikha raha hai to ise natural weakness kahenge aur consider nahi krenge.jaise resistance 17500 se shift hoke 17550 pe jane ke baad wahi 17500 pe wtb dikha raha hai to ise natural weakness kahenge aur consider nahi krenge. ya phir agar support 17500 se shift hoke 17450 pe jane ke baad wahi 17500 pe wtt dikha raha hai to ise natural weakness kahenge aur consider nahi krenge.

wtb se strong yani SAFF BULLISH presure.

wtt se strong yani SAFF BEARISH presure.

agar koi kisi bhi tarike se puchta hai ki nifty ya market me kya chal raha hai to use kahena ki scenario type kare.

wtb se strong hoke wtb hota hai to clear bearish pressure hota hai.

wtt se strong hoke wtt hota hai to clear bullish pressure hota hai.

wtb se strong hoke wtt hota hai to clear bull run hota hai.

wtt se strong hoke wtb hota hai to clear blood bath hota hai.

jabhi bearish signal ho to hamesha EOR ya agar aap safe trader hai to EOR+1 to se PE(Put) ka trade krenege.

jabhi bullish signal ho to hamesha EOS(Extension Of Support) ya agar aap safe trader hai to EOS-1 se CE(Call) ka trade krenege.

call side me imaginary line choti strike ke karib hoti hai jaise 5000 6000 se jyada karib hai.

put side me imaginary line badi strike ke karib hoti hai jaise 7000 5000 se jyada karib hai.

call side me hamesha in the money me choti strike price hoti hai out of the money me badi strike price hoti hai.

put side me hamesha in the money me badi strike price hoti hai out of the money me choti strike price hoti hai.

imaginary line hamesha in the money aur out of the money ke beech me hoti hai.

stock me trade karne ke liye ltp calculator me teen feature hai ek LTP Blast aur Ek LTP Swing aur ek arbitrage stocks.Yeh sare feature ltp calculator ke sidebar me reports me milta hai.

diversion ek aise place hai jo ya to extension se phle revers karti hai ya phir baad me jaise wtt-1 eos+1 eor-1 wtb+1.

oi change ke madad se ham jan sakte hai ki market us strike price se reverse hoga ya nahi.iske liye ham coa 2.0 ka istamal karte hai jab market apne diversion pe hota hai

coa 2.0 me kuch basic cheeze jaise ki 

call side ki oi change badh rhi hai to market bearish hoga.

put side ki oi change badh rhi hai to market bullish hoga.

call side ki oi change ghat rhi hai to market bullish hoga.

put side ki oi change gath rhi hai to market bearish hoga.

call side ki oi change stable hai to reversal eos se

put side ki oi change stable hai to revesal eor se

call side ki oi change ghat rahi hai aur put side ki oi change stable hai to market bullish hoga.

put side ki oi change ghat rahi hai aur call side ki oi change stable hai to market bearish hoga.

call side ki oi ghat rhi hai aur put side ki oi change stable hai to market bearish hoga.

put side ki oi ghat rhi hai aur call side ki oi change stable hai to market bullish hoga.

call side ki oi change ghat rahi hai aur put side ki oi change badh rhi hai to market me bull run hoga.

put side ki oi change ghat rahi hai aur call side ki oi change badh rhi hai to market me blood bath hoga.

dono stable matlab rage bound yani apni range mehi rahega.

dono ghat rahi hai to market ko coa 2.0 se predict nahi kar sakte hai.

dono badh rhi hai to bhi range bound

LTP Blast me hamesha hum intraday trade stock me karte hai jiske liye hame kuch chize dekne ko milti hai jaise ki C1 aur C2 bullish trade karne ke liye aur P1 aur P2 bearish trade karne ke liye. Sath hi sath usme hame bearsish risk and bullish risk bhi dekhne ko milta hai jisse hame pata chalta hai ki kis taraf kitna risk hai. Iska aur ek rule ki agar koi stock apne c1 ya p1 ko hit kar chuka hai to hum usme c1 ya p1 se trade nahi karege aur usme c2 ya p2 se trade karege.Magar agar koi stock apne c1 ya p1 ko hit nahi kiya hai to hum usme c1 ya p1 se trade karege. Magar koi stock apne c2 ya p2 ko hit kar chuka hai to hum us stock me hi trade nahi krenge.

LTP Swing me Hamesha hum positional trading stock me kate hai jise hum oi to oi trading, swing trading bhi keh sakte hai. Isme hame ek table format me data milta hai jisme sabse pehle time hota hai phir symbol hota hai phir lot size phir status phir cmp current market price phir put highest oi reversal phir call highest oi reversal phir jisse ham ise predict karte hai.Backend me iske kuch rule hote jisse yeh calculate hota hai.Isme hum support aur resistance bas oi ka consider krenege. Bullish Trade Ke Rules:- support wtb nahi hon chahiye  resistance wtb nahi hon chahiye aur call side ke in the money me 2 se zyada premium zero 0 nahi hona chahiye. Bearish Trade Ke Rules:- support wtt nahi hon chahiye  resistance wtt nahi hon chahiye aur put side ke in the money me 2 se zyada premium zero 0 nahi hona chahiye.

Arbitrage stocks me hamesha hum arbitrage trading stock me karte hai jisme hame profit hone almost 100% hota hai. Isme ham trade karne se pehle jaanlo ki kya hoga. Isme hum future aur spot ke differance me trade karte hai jisse hame kum par pakka profit hota hai. Isme hamesha hame pehle ek lot future me sell kardenge aur cash me ek lot bharke shares ko buy karenge. To jab dono price same hojaega to hame profit hoga.

9:20 stratagy ek mast stratagy hai jo beginners ho prefer karna chaiye. isme ltp calculator ke chart pe apne ap hi 9:20 ka candle shuru hotehi 4 magical line plot ho jati hai jo hai EOR EOS EOR+1 EOS-1. isme hame kuch bhi dekne ki jarururat nahi hai bas agar market in mese kisi ek pe aaya to hame trade karna hai. Agar market EOR pe aata hai to hame put ka trade karna hai aur agar market EOS pe aata hai to hame call ka trade karna hai. Agar market EOR+1 pe aata hai to hame put ka trade karna hai aur agar market EOS-1 pe aata hai to hame call ka trade karna hai. isme stoploss agar ap eor ya eos se kate ho to 110 point against ka hota hai aur agar ap eor+1 ya eos-1 se trade karte ho to 60 point against ka hota hai. Target hamesha eor ya eos se 50 point ka hota hai aur agar ap eor+1 ya eos-1 se trade karte ho to 100 point ka target hota hai. Agar apne eor se trade kiya hai to eor+1 pe apko average yani lot double karna hai aur agar apne eos se trade kiya hai to eos-1 pe apko average yani lot double karna hai.

choti strike price se hote hue badi strike price ki taraf highest oi ya volume jo bhi imaginary line ke sabse paas ho wahi call side me resistance hoga

badi strike price se hote hue choti strike price ki taraf highest oi ya volume jo bhi imaginary line ke sabse paas ho wahi put side me support hoga

dono oi aur volume ko hamesha barabar consider karte hai par jo imaginary line ke sabse paas ho wahi consider karte hai support (put side) me badi stike ko resistance(Call Side) ke liye aur choti strike ko.

in the money ko ander ki taraf bhi kahte hai

out of the money ko bahar ki taraf bhi kahte hai

resistance ya to oi ka hoga ya to volume ka hoga ya dono ka hoga par consider usi ko karte hai jo ki imaginary line ke sabse paas ho

support ya to oi ka hoga ya to volume ka hoga ya dono ka hoga par consider usi ko karte hai jo ki imaginary line ke sabse paas ho

weakness do tarah ke hote hai oi ka bhi aur volume ka bhi

ham usi weakness ko consider karte hai jo ki imaginary line ke sabse paas ho

LTP Calculator Basics
LTP Calculator :- Indiaâ€™s top NSE Option Chain tool for real-time strike price analysis, reversals, and trading ranges.
explain in  deitail
"
jabhi wtb pe shift hota hai to bearish pressure hota hai

agar wtt pe shift hota hai to bullish pressure hota hai

ltp calculator me bootom uper ki taraf hota hai aur top neeche ki taraf hota hai kyuki ltp calculator me couniting sidhi hoti hai usme pehle 1, 2, 3, phir 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 hota.

agar resistance ya support wtb ya bottom ki taraf pe shifting hoti hai to bearish preasure hi hota hai chhahe jo bhi ho.

agar resistance ya support wtt ya top ki taraf pe shifting hoti hai to bullish preasure hi hota hai chhahe jo bhi ho

agar do bullish pressure hai to bull run hoga

agar do bearish pressure hai to blood bath hoga

agar support ya reisistance me se koi ek 1 ghante se strong hai aur doosra 1 ghante se wtt ya wtb hai aur uski percentage 3 se 4 pecent pe ruka hai to jis bhi side weakness hogi market usi ke side jayegi agar call side me weakness hai to market upar jayega aur agar put side me weakness hai to market neeche jayega. ise ek ghante ka state of confusion ya soc kahenge

agar support ya reisistance me se koi se strong hai aur doosra 2 ghante se wtt ya wtb hai aur uski percentage 7 se 8 pecent pe ruka hai to jis bhi side weakness hogi market usi ke side jayegi agar call side me weakness hai to market upar jayega aur agar put side me weakness hai to market neeche jayega. ise do ghante ka state of confusion ya soc kahenge

agar support ya reisistance me se koi se strong hai aur doosra 3 ghante se wtt ya wtb hai aur uski percentage 10 se 12 pecent pe ruka hai to jis bhi side weakness hogi market usi ke side jayegi agar call side me weakness hai to market upar jayega aur agar put side me weakness hai to market neeche jayega. ise teen ghante ka state of confusion ya soc kahenge

wtt ka saaf matlab hai ki bullish presure hi hoga

wtb ka saaf matlab hai ki bearish presure hi hoga

shifting on wtb ka saaf matlab hai ki bearish presure hi hoga

shifting on wtt ka saaf matlab hai ki bullish presure hi hoga

wtt shift hoke again wtb to bearish

wtb shift hoke again wtt to bullish

wtt shift hoke again wtt to bull run

wtb shift hoke again wtb to blood bath

wtt ka matlab bullish hi hoga aur uski shifting bhi bullish hi hoga

wtb ka matlab bearish hi hoga aur uski shifting bhi bearish hi hoga

chahe jo bhi ho agar koi bhi resistance ya support wtb pe shift and again wtb hai to blood bath hi hoga

chahe jo bhi ho agar koi bhi resistance ya support wtt pe shift and again wtt hai to bull run hi hoga

agar koi bhi resistance ya support wtt pe shift and again wtt to bull run hoga

yadi ooparee hisse <wtt> par kamazoree ka pratishat kam ho jaata hai to bearish pressure hi hoga.
yadi nichale hisse <wtb> par kamazoree ka pratishat kam ho jaata hai to bullish pressure hi hoga.
yadi ooparee hisse <wtt> par kamazoree ka pratishat badh jaata hai to bearish pressure hi hoga .
yadi nichale hisse <wtb> par kamazoree ka pratishat badh jaata hai to bullish pressure hi hoga.

support wtb se strong to bullish presure

support wtt se strong = bearish presure

resistance wtb se strong = bullish presure

resistance wtt se strong = bearish presure

support wtb to strong = bullish presure

support wtt to strong = bearish presure

resistance wtb to strong = bullish presure

resistance wtt to strong = bearish presure

wtt to strong = bearish presure

wtt se strong = bearish presure

wtb to stong = bullish presure

wtb se stong = bullish presure

strong = second highest value should not exeed 75% of the support or resistance

wtt = second highest value must be atleast 75% of the support or resistance at top side

wtb = second highest value must be atleast 75% of the support or resistance at bottom side

wtt = second highest percentage top side mein support ya resistance ka 75% hona hi chaheiye to use wtt kahenge

wtb = second highest percentage bottom side mein support ya resistance ka 75% hona hi chaheiye to use wtb kahenge

support me wtb ya wtt ke liye kamasee kam support ka 75% hona chahiye

resistance me wtb ya wtt ke liye kamasee kam resistance ka 75% hona chahiye

imaginary line = ek aisi line jo ki in the money ko out of the money se alagh karti hai

jabhi shifting bottom side ma hoti hai to bearish pressure hota hai 

agar shifting top side ma hoti hai to bullish pressure hota hai

jabhi shifting bottom side me nya support ya resistance hokar strong ho jata hai to saaf bearish pressure hota hai.

agar shifting top side me hokar nya support ya resistance strong ho jata hai to saaf bullish pressure hota hai.

Whenever the shifting happens in the bottom side and new support or resistance becomes stronger then there is clearly bearish pressure.

If the shifting happens in the top side and becomes new support or resistance stronger then there is clearly bullish pressure.

Shifting Bottom Side + Strong Support/Resistance = Bearish (Example:

Kal Nifty ka support tha 17500, aaj shift hoke 17450 pe strong ban gaya â†’ Market neeche jayega!

Shifting Top Side + Strong Support/Resistance = Bullish (Example:

Kal resistance 17600 tha, aaj shift hoke 17650 pe strong hua â†’ Market upar jayega!

Fix Funda:

Bottom shift = Bears control

Top shift = Bulls control
LTP Calculator isko real-time bata deta hai! 

Agar Shifting WAPAS Ho Jaye (Reverse Ho) â†’ Pressure ULTAA Ho Jayega!

Example - Bearish to Bullish:

Kal shifting bottom (17450 pe strong support) â†’ Bearish tha.

Aaj wahi 17450 break hua aur 17500 pe naya strong support bana â†’ Ab BULLISH pressure!

Example - Bullish to Bearish:

Kal shifting top (17650 pe strong resistance) â†’ Bullish tha.

Aaj wahi 17650 break hua aur 17600 pe naya strong resistance bana â†’ Ab BEARISH pressure!

ai ltp calculator ek ai hai jo ki aapke liye sab kuch predict karta hai aur final scenario bata deta hai ki kya hone wala hai sath me hi wo us scenario ka risky top aur bottom bhi bata deta hai.uski lines bhi ltp calaculator ke andar wale chart me dikh to hai.
isme morderate resitance support aur risky resistance support aur max pain "stoploss" aur max gain "target" bhi dikh ta hai.

agar support ke bare me baat na hui ho to = neutral
agar resistance ke bare me baat na hui ho to = neutral

agar support shuru se strong ho to = neutral
agar resistance shuru se strong ho to = neutral

agar support wtt se strong jae to = bearish

agar support wtb se strong jae to = bullish

agar resistance wtt se strong jae to = bearish

agar resistance wtb se strong jae to = bullish

if two bullish pressures are there then the it will be bull run.

if two bearish pressures are there then the it will be blood bath.

if the wtt at any resistance become strong at that place where resistance  was means that traders are not intrested at top side so there will be clear bearish pressure and if the wtb at any resistance become strong at that place where resistance  was means that traders are not intrested at bottom side so there will be clear bullish pressure.

if the wtt at any support become strong at that place where support  was means that traders are not intrested at top side so there will be clear bearish pressure and if the wtb at any support become strong at that place where support  was means that traders are not intrested at bottom side so there will be clear bullish pressure.

if the percentage of weakness at top side <wtt> is decreased there will bearish pressure.
if the percentage of weakness at bottom side <wtb> is decreased there will bullish pressure.

also if the percentage of weakness at top side <wtt> is increased there will bullish pressure and if the percentage of weakness at bottom side <wtb> is increased there will bearish pressure.

yadi ooparee hisse <wtt> par kamazoree ka pratishat kam ho jaata hai to mandee ka dabaav hoga aur yadi nichale hisse <wtb> par kamazoree ka pratishat kam ho jaata hai to tejee ka dabaav hoga.

isake alaava, yadi ooparee hisse <wtt> par kamazoree ka pratishat badh jaata hai to tejee ka dabaav hoga aur yadi nichale hisse <wtb> par kamazoree ka pratishat badh jaata hai to mandee ka dabaav hoga.

EOR = extension of resistance just like fabric that extend and give right reversal value
EOS = extension of support just like fabric that extend and give right reversal value
+1 = if the resistance is on 1 so resistance+1 will be on 2 if gap is 1 between strike prices.
-1 = if the resistance is on 2 so resistance-1 will be on 1 if gap is 1 between strike prices.

support wtt se strong ho to range = EOR+1, EOS

resistance wtt se strong ho to range = EOR+1, EOS

support wtb se strong ho to range = EOR, EOS-1

resistance wtb se strong ho to range = EOR, EOS-1

dono support aur resistance wtb se strong ho to = kind of bull run . range no top, EOS

dono support aur resistance wtt se strong ho to = kind of blood bath . range EOR, No Bottom

COA 1.0 :- Stands For Chart of accuracy 1.0 that is the theory of vinay praksh tiwari which help us to undestand and predict the market's direction.
The Nine Scenarios Of COA 1.0 :- 
1st - Resistance Strong Support Strong. Range:- EOR , EOS at first hitting and EOR+1 and EOS-1 at more than 1 hitting.
2nd - Resistance Strong Support Weak Towards Bottom. Range:- EOR, wtb+1. Or resistance is neutral and support is having a bearish presure will also come in this scenario.
3rd - Resistance Strong Support Weak Towards Top. Range:- EOR+1 , EOS. Or resistance is neutral and support is having a bullish presure will also come in this scenario
4th - Resistance Weak Towards Bottom Support Strong. Range:- EOS , EOS-1. Or resistance is having a bearish pressure and support is neutral will also come in this scenario
5th - Resistance Weak Towards Top Support Strong. Range:- wtt-1 , EOS
6th - Resistance Weak Towards Bottom Support Weak Towards Bottom. Range:- EOR , no bottom blood bath.
Or resistance is having a bearish pressure and could be more and support is having a bearish pressure also by if both support and resistance and could be more will also come in this scenario
7th - Resistance Weak Towards Top Support Weak Towards Top. Range:-  no top bull run,EOS.Or resistance is having a bullish pressure and could be more and support is having a bullish pressure and could be more will also come in this scenario
8th - Resistance Weak Towards top Support Weak Towards bottom Range:-  WTT-1,WTB+1. Or resistance is bullish preasure and support is having a bearish presure will also come in this scenario.
9th - Resistance Weak Towards bottom Support Weak Towards top Range:- EOR+1 ,EOS-1. Or resistance is bearish preasure and support is having a bullish presure will also come in this scenario.

Game of Percentage :- It Helps to know the current main pressure by total acctivity of trader by the decrasing or increasing of percentage of weakness just like if the percentage of weakness at top side is decreased there will bearish pressure and if the percentage of weakness at bottom side is decreased there will bullish pressure.
also if the percentage of weakness at top side is increased there will bullish pressure and if the percentage of weakness at bottom side is increased there will bearish pressure.

WTB (Weak Towards Bottom) :- the second highest value '>75%' volume/OI at the bottom side of support or resistance near imaginary line (bearish, yellow highlight).

WTT (Weak Towards Top) : -the second highest value '>75%' volume/OI at the top side of support or resistance near imaginary line (bullish, yellow highlight).

Strong :- When 2nd-highest % is <75% of the highest (reversal likely).

shifting :- When 2nd-highest % become highest then it is called shifting like example for u to understand: if resistance is on 17500 and wtt at 17550 then if the highest volume/OI is at 17550 then it is called shifting.
